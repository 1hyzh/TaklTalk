### You can choose either to host or connect to a server

### To connect between two computers one should join the servers IP adress (can be found in ipconfig in windows or hostname -I in linux)
(in a future update i maybe will add something so you can see the servers ip, not 127.0.0.1 because if you try to connect to that one from a different computer even in the same LAN it won't work)
